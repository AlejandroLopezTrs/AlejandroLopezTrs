My name is Alejandro Lopez Torres. 
I reside in Southern California and have trasitioned carrers into software developement.
To pursue this goal, I am currently enrolled in Tech Elevator.
I am currently learning as many aspects of software development as I possible can including different languages, how to use Git Hub, and Visual Code Studio.
Fun fact, I have many hobbies involving the outdoors such as camping, hiking, fishing, and gardening.
